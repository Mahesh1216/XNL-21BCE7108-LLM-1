Explanation of phases:
Phase -1 : implemented LLM-powered sentiment analysis to predict market trends using news and social media data. Real-time market data ingestion was set up using Yahoo Finance, Binance API, and Alpha Vantage to fetch stock/crypto updates. A multi-agent financial decision system was built with AI agents for risk assessment, trade execution, and fraud detection. Neo4j-based graph anomaly detection was introduced to detect suspicious trading activities. This phase ensures data-driven trading decisions and regulatory compliance.

Phase-2 :
